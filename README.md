# Analyzing Stock Price Movements with Apriori Algorithm

The stock market is a complex and dynamic system, influenced by a wide range of economic, political, and social factors. As a result, predicting stock prices and identifying trends and patterns can be a difficult and time-consuming task. However, with the increasing availability of data and advancements in machine learning algorithms, it is becoming easier to extract insights and make informed decisions.

In this project, we will explore the use of the Apriori algorithm for analyzing stock price movements and identifying frequent itemsets and association rules among a set of 50 popular stocks. We will use historical daily price data from January 1st, 2022 to March 31st, 2023, obtained through the Yahoo Finance API. By analyzing these data, we hope to gain a better understanding of how different stocks relate to each other and potentially identify useful patterns for investors and traders.
